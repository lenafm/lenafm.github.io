I am a PhD student in the Computational Social Science team lead by Camille Roth, at Centre Marc
                        Bloch in Berlin, and at the Center of Analysis and Social Mathematics (CAMS) at École des
                        hautes études en sciences sociales (EHESS) in Paris.

I am fascinated by many topics around the theory and application of complex networks. I am
                        particularly interested in emergent dynamics of complex networks in the political and
                        social sphere and in methods for the detection of intermediate-scale
                        structures in networks.

In the context of the ERC [socsemics](https://socsemics.huma-num.fr/) project,
                        my current project focuses on analysing and understanding online conversations and fragmentation
                        processes of such conversations by studying 'socio-semantic clusters' in online public spaces.
