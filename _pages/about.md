I am a PhD student in the Computational Social Science team lead by Camille Roth, at Centre Marc Bloch (Berlin), 
and at the Center of Analysis and Social Mathematics (CAMS), EHESS (Paris).

I am fascinated by many topics around the theory and application of complex networks. I am particularly interested in 
methods for the detection of intermediate-scale structures in networks and in the application of such methods to 
understand emergent dynamics of complex networks in the political and social sphere.

In the context of the ERC [socsemics](https://socsemics.huma-num.fr/) project my PhD project focuses on the diversity 
of block structure in networks, the relationship between metadata and such block structure, and an exploration of these 
phenomena in the specific context of online interaction networks and semantic node attributes.
