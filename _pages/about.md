I am a postdoctoral researcher working at the intersection of network science, statistical modelling, 
and computational social science. My research focuses on the development of Bayesian inferential 
methods for studying structure in complex networks and high-dimensional data, with a particular 
emphasis on intermediate-scale structures. 

Alongside my methodological work on network models, I am interested in the use of quantitative 
and computational approaches to investigate broader questions related to inequality, 
representation, and the dynamics of political and social organisation. I am particularly drawn 
to research that examines how patterns of interaction, communication, and the circulation of 
information shape, and are shaped by, societal structures. 

My doctoral research, conducted within the ERC [socsemics](https://socsemics.huma-num.fr/) project under the supervision 
of Prof. Camille Roth, focused on the diversity of block structure in networks, the relationship 
between metadata and such block structure, and the development of generative and 
information-theoretic tools to study these phenomena. This work was empirically 
motivated by questions arising in online interaction networks, where relational structure 
and semantic information coexist in complex and not always overlapping ways.
