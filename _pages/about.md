I am a PhD student in the Computational Social Science team lead by Camille Roth, at Centre Marc Bloch (Berlin), 
and at the Center of Analysis and Social Mathematics (CAMS), EHESS (Paris).

I am fascinated by many topics around the theory and application of complex networks. I am particularly interested in 
methods for the detection of intermediate-scale structures in networks and in the application of such methods to 
understand emergent dynamics of complex networks in the political and social sphere.

In the context of the ERC [socsemics](https://socsemics.huma-num.fr/) project my PhD project focuses on analysing and 
understanding online conversations and configurations of such conversations through the lens of complex networks. 
Recently, I have been studying the diversity of block structure in networks and the relationship between metadata and 
such block structure, and these phenomena in the specific context of online interaction networks and semantic node 
attributes.
