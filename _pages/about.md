I am a postdoctoral researcher working at the intersection of network science, statistical modelling, 
and computational social science. My research focuses on the development of Bayesian inferential 
methods for studying structure in complex networks.

Alongside my methodological work, I am interested in the use of quantitative 
and computational approaches to investigate broader questions related to inequality, 
representation, and the dynamics of political and social organisation. 

My doctoral research focused on the diversity of block structure in networks, the relationship 
between metadata and such block structure, and an exploration of these phenomena in the specific context of 
online interaction networks.
